# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1  
**Which point(s) were new to you?**

One point that was new to me was about **over-communicating with the team**.

I didn’t know that things like informing the team even when you have no internet or your laptop isn't working are considered good practices. I used to think it’s okay if I just fix the issue silently or tell only one person, but now I understand that keeping the whole team updated is actually important. It helps avoid confusion and delays.

Also, I never thought about keeping the video on during meetings to build better rapport with teammates. I usually keep it off, but now I’ll try turning it on more often to improve communication.

## Question 2  
**Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

I think I need to improve on how I ask for help when I’m stuck.

Usually, I just message my teammate or mentor saying “this is not working” without much context. After reading this, I realized that’s not helpful at all and might even waste their time. I should be more clear and explain the issue properly.

### How I plan to improve:
- From now on, I’ll explain what I’m trying to do and what’s going wrong.
- I’ll write down what I’ve already tried to fix the problem.
- I’ll start using Loom to record short videos if needed.
- I’ll also use GitHub Gists or CodeSandbox to share my code when it’s too long.

This way, I can make it easier for others to understand my issue, and maybe even solve it faster myself while writing it all down.
