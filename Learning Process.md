# Learning Methods Made Easy

### Q1: What is the Feynman Technique
The Feynman Technique is a method where you explain something in simple words, like teaching a child, to understand it better.

### Q2: Most Inspiring Idea from Barbara Oakley
- She failed in maths but later became an engineering professor
- Our brain learns in two ways:
  - Focused mode (when you sit and concentrate)
  - Diffused mode (when you’re relaxed, like walking or bathing)
- Taking breaks and sleeping well actually helps you learn
- Anyone can learn difficult things if they use the right way

### Q3: Two Ways Your Brain Learns
**Focused Thinking:**
- Happens when you sit to study
- Good for solving one clear problem
- It’s like using a zoom lens to see small details

**Diffused Thinking:**
- Happens when you’re relaxed
- Helps you connect ideas and think better
- It’s like getting cool ideas while walking or brushing

### Q4: Learn New Things in 20 Hours
1. Break the topic into small parts
2. Learn enough so you can notice mistakes when you make them
3. Make sure you’re not distracted while practicing
4. Do 20 hours of serious practice
   (Like: 40 minutes a day → 1 month)

### Q5: Simple Learning Boosters
- Keep phone silent and block social media while studying
- Teach someone else what you learn
- Study in small rounds (25–50 mins), then take a break
- Sleep properly — your brain keeps learning when you sleep
- Use apps like Forest to help stay focused
- If you don’t understand something, ask! Don’t waste time waiting

**Learning is like growing a plant — small care every day gives big results!**
