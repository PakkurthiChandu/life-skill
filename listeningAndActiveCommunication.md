## 2. Reflective Listening

### Question 2: According to Fisher’s model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? (in your own words, simple English)

Fisher’s model says that we should try to clearly understand what the speaker wants to say. Important points are:

1. **Carefully Listen**: Focus on what the person says and how they feel.
2. **Repeat What They Say**: Use my own words to say what they told, to show I understood.
3. **Check Their Feelings**: Notice their emotions and talk about that too, like “You sound sad about this.”
4. **Confirm**: Ask if I understood right, like “Is that what you mean?”
5. **Don’t Judge**: Just listen and understand; don’t give advice unless they ask.
6. **Build Trust**: Show respect so that they feel safe talking to me.

## 3. Reflection

### Question 3: What are the obstacles in your listening process?

1. **Distractions**: Mobile, noise, or thinking about other things while listening.
2. **Judging Early**: I sometimes form an opinion before hearing fully.
3. **Emotional Reactions**: Sometimes I react emotionally and stop listening.
4. **Mind Wandering**: My mind goes somewhere else while the other person is talking.
5. **Impatience**: I feel like talking quickly, so I interrupt sometimes.
6. **Wrong Understanding**: I assume what the person wants to say without checking properly.

### Question 4: What can you do to improve your listening?

1. **Avoid Distractions**: Keep my phone away, sit in a quiet place.
2. **Be Patient**: Wait till the other person finishes.
3. **Body Language**: Nod my head, look at the person to show interest.
4. **Ask Questions**: Ask if I don’t understand.
5. **Write Important Points**: For important talks, I can note down points.
6. **Understand Feelings**: Notice how the person feels, not just what they are saying.

## 4. Types of Communication

### Question 5: When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

I become passive when:

1. I want to avoid fights, like when my friend chooses a plan I don’t like.
2. I feel shy to talk, especially with new people or in meetings.
3. I want to be polite, so I stay quiet even if I don’t agree.

### Question 6: When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

I become aggressive when:

1. I get angry, like when someone doesn’t listen to me during a group discussion.
2. I feel stressed, like when others delay their work and it affects my tasks too.
3. I feel like I’m being wrongly blamed, then I defend strongly.

### Question 7: When do you switch into Passive Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

I become passive-aggressive when:

1. I’m upset but don’t want to argue, so I give sarcastic replies.
2. I feel ignored, so I stop replying properly to that person.
3. I’m irritated but don’t show it, and maybe talk behind their back instead.

### Question 8: How can you make your communication assertive? (Give a few steps you can apply in your own life)

Steps I can use to be more assertive:

1. **Use “I” Statements**: Say what *I* feel, like “I feel bad when I’m not informed about changes.”
2. **Stay Calm**: Even if I’m upset, I will speak softly and respectfully.
3. **Be Direct**: Say clearly what I need, like “Can you please explain that part again?”
4. **Listen First**: Let the other person talk first, then I will share my view.
5. **Practice Speaking Up**: In meetings or group work, I will speak up when I have ideas.
6. **Say No Politely**: If I can’t do something, I will clearly but politely say no.
